# Stelvio
## Stelvio, as the name references the historic Italian street, is a canvas element curve generating visialization. 
#### This is based on the hard work done by the Siriwave creator Flavio De Stefano. 
#### Based on Flavio's blog post: https://dev.to/kopiro/how-i-built-the-siriwavejs-library-a-look-at-the-math-and-the-code-l0o
#### I was able to recreate his Siriwave implementation.  
#### Thank you.

### The goal of this project was to create a visualization - that could be packaged into a .net Blazor component.
### The visualization may provide a subtle enhancment to the play state of a custom audio element. 
### This repo represents the first step in that process.
